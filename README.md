# OOP Concepts in Java

This is a beginner-friendly GitHub project that demonstrates all key concepts of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm using Java (compatible with OpenJDK 24.0.1) and Gradle. The project includes simple, working code examples with detailed comments to explain each concept.

## Prerequisites
- Java: OpenJDK 24.0.1 (or compatible version). Download from https://openjdk.org/.
- Gradle: Version 8.x or later (the project uses Gradle wrapper, so you can use `./gradlew` commands).

## How to Set Up and Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repo-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OOPConceptsInJava`.
3. Build the project: `./gradlew build` (on Windows: `gradlew.bat build`).
4. Run the application: `./gradlew run`.
    - This will execute the `Main` class, which demonstrates all OOP concepts with console output.

The project structure is:
- `src/main/java/com/example/oop/`: Contains all Java source files with examples.
- `build.gradle`: Gradle build configuration.
- `settings.gradle`: Project settings.

## OOP Concepts Covered
This project explains and demonstrates the four pillars of OOP plus related concepts:
1. **Classes and Objects**: Basic building blocks.
2. **Encapsulation**: Hiding data with access modifiers.
3. **Inheritance**: Extending classes (single and multilevel).
4. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and overloading.
5. **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and interfaces.
6. **Additional Concepts**: Constructors, static members, final keyword, etc.

Each concept is shown in separate classes, and `Main.java` ties them together with examples.

## Detailed Explanations
Refer to the code comments in each file for in-depth explanations. Run the code to see outputs that illustrate how each concept works.
